This project is mainly inspired by the ``pycrazyswarm`` of `crazyswarm <https://github.com/USC-ACTLab/crazyswarm/tree/master/ros_ws/src/crazyswarm/scripts/pycrazyswarm>`_, which is a python wrapper around crazyswarm ROS nodes to control crazyflie UAV swarm. Thanks for their remarkable work! Crazyswarm1 documentation: https://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
